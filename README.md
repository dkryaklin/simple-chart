~~This chart was ready only on the half for stage 1 and never submitted.
For stage 2 it was rebuilt from scratch in one week~~

This library base on web components and svg.
All styles is encapsulated which is most advantage in current solution
Also with polyfill it can work even in IE and Edge

Good news:
* Looks goodly and works well on desktop and mobiles.
* Size for gzip is about 10kb.
* Can easily customize for any project.
* There are new component which can converter for framework or whatever.
* Core part (lines for scroll and chart) can easily replaced to any other technology (e.g. canvas) and not requierd changes in other places.


Bad news:
* Some animation is missed. Performance is poorly in some cases.
* Pie chart even not started.
